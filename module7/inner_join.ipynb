    "\n",
    "If you to combine data from 3 or more different tables. You simply add more joins to the SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: We want to know which borrowers have a book on loan and we also want to know which copy of the book they have.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " We join the tables 2 by 2. First we join the information from the borrower table and loan table where the borrower_id is match, then we join the information from the loan table and the copy table where the copy_id is match.\n",
